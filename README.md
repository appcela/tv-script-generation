# tv-script-generation
Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree Program Project to use RNNs to generate Seinfeld TV scripts. 

# Project Overview

In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
